                    <p>The spring of 2022 I joined, re:Bloom, a non profit that pairs women, minority owned small business with designers and developers to create websites or applications. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For this cohort, another developer and I were paired with Wendy Glich, CEO of Selling Later, to <u>create a hi-fi interactive prototype</u> that redesigned her current website and integrated new features such as a service provider database and real estate education course.</p>

                        In order to create a successful redesign, we had to take inventory of the pain points in her current website. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Biggest Problems:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Unitutive Navigation
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                No integration of new features: Searchable database and Education tab
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        We spent a week creating a site map that would allow easy access to key features for users, as well as brainstorming intuitive labels for each of our pages. This proved to more difficult than expected and we continually iterated on our navigation headings through the entire project.

                        Once we had a good grasp on the elements we wanted to include and a rough idea of the navigation, we created and tested a mid-fi prototype to workout any navigational and functional bugs in our design. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our biggest feedback came from our navigational headings (as we were expecting) so we continued to iterate on our labels and tested them again in our second round round of user testing.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In our second round of user testing, we tested our hi fi, fully interactive prototype with users who were familiar with the old site, as well as our previous mid-fi prototype.

                        Since re:Bloom aims to make technology easily accessible to the community. They  teach small businesses owners and non-profit founders how to incorporate and use technology to expand their reach and meet their goals.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For us to accomplish this goal in our project, we created documentation for future developers to understand and replicate our prototype accurately.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Working with a real client has been extremely rewarding and Ms. Glich was even able to show our hi-fi prototype to the National Fair Housing Alliance. I hope to continue more work like this in the future!
