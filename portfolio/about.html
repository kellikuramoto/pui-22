                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    Coming into Carnegie Mellon undecided was very daunting because it seemed as though everyone knew what they wanted to do.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Luckily, my freshman year I stumbled across the only design class I could register for: Interaction Desing Overview and I was introduced to my passion: Human Centered Design.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since then, I have been a passionate and aspiring UX Designer. Continually in awe of the idea that I can create products that help people. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am excited to announce that I will be working at CoStar Group this summer, 2022, as a UX Design intern out of thier Washington D.C. office.
