Description:
The purpose of my website is to showcase my past design work, including case studies completed for previous classes and internships. My current case studies include: hi-fi prototype for Selling Later, website for PUI, game for PUI, and website for Mobile Web Design & Development. I hope to convey my design skills and abilities through my multiple case studies. Skills include: understanding of human centered design process, user research methods, prototyping abilities, and proficiency in software such as Figma and Adobe XD. My target audience would be possible future employers or other designers looking at my portfolio for inspiration. I tried to make my website interesting through transition animations, font choice, and color that changes based on what case study is being presented.

Using your Website:
Home page
- scroll to see the four different case studies being presented
    - click on ‘Case Study’ to view in depth process of project
- click on ‘About’ to see information about my journey in design and work history

Case study
- scroll to see process
- click on side nav bar to view specific section of project
- click on ‘Next Project’ to see next project in portfolio 

External Libraries:
Animate.css, I chose to use Animate.css because I thought their animations were clean and useful for my specific purpose in my design portfolio. I use transition, slideInLeft on the Home Page when it is first loaded for the title and the Case Study button. I also use the transition slideInRight on the About Page for the title and description of myself. I think that it adds a lightness to the website and makes it feel alive when a user clicks on a new page. I didn’t want my animations to take away from the website so I did not use animations on every section of every page, just enough so that it wouldn’t seem static.

Iteration from hw7:
The project that I am turning in for assignment 8 is not the game that I had proposed in assignment 7. The game that I proposed I built out in a shorter amount of time than I was expecting so I decided to build a portfolio as well and include this game in my portfolio. You can find it under ‘Tartordle’, feel free to play it! In terms of my portfolio design for assignment 8, I have had previous iterations that I have wanted to build out, but I changed the design because I really liked the idea of changing the background and text color based on which case study was being highlighted. 

Major Challenges:
Major challenges that I faced when coding my portfolio was sensing what section was visible on the screen and dynamically changing the text based on what case study image was visible on the home page. I found a similar problem when I implemented the sub nav on the individual case studies. The feedback for which section you were on was not highlighting correctly because my event listener was set to the wrong div and my previous code required the entire section to be showing. This caused problems because some sections were longer than the viewport so I had to alter accordingly. I also had to figure out how to make my design responsive which was difficult due to some elements needing to be changed to hidden given smaller screen sizes.
