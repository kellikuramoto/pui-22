                        Our group started our project by conducting 2 semi structured interviews each, 6 in total, with one of our stakeholders: Student, Staff, or Faculty. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Each interview lasted about 30 minutes and we allowed the participant to explain to knowledge of Dietrich College’s DEI Stratgeic Plan, what type of information they thought would be in the plan, as well as any other information that they would like displayed. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Starting with user research gave our group a strong foundation for our project by understanding the problem space and allowed us to better empathize with our stakeholders.

                    <p class="process-description">
                        Based on our initial secondary user research, we created 3 persons to exemplify our target audience: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Current and Prospective Student</li>
                            <li>Current and Prospective Faculty</li>
                            <li>Current and Prospective Staff</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                        We provided information regarding their motivations, general interest, goals, tasks, and frustrations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While designing our initial wireframes we kept our personas in mind, thinking about which information from the DEI strategic plan we wanted to present and how we wanted to present it.

                    <p class="process-description">
                        In order to design the best website given our time constraints, we conducted 2 rounds of user test. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For our first round we conducted an A/B testing between my initial design and my teammates design. My design highlighted a single page, multi dashboard design while my teammates design was multi page, in depth presentation of information.<br>
                        <div id="dei-design-img">

                        <div>
                            We had overhwleming positive feedback torwards the single page, multi dashboard design, so we decided to iterate on that design for our final. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Apart from deciding which design direction to purse, some other feedback we received and implemented included:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Changed the background color of the dashboard to give a lighter feel to the overall website</li>
                                <li>Added headings to the 'Goals' on each dashboard to provide clear feedback for the user</li>
                                <li>Added a 'Contact' and 'Additional Resources' section to the bottom of the page based on user research</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            <p>After all the changes were made, we ran a second round of user testing and our main feedback received was  there was possibly not enough information presented. In order to combat that issue, alongside the continue client interest of simplicity and digestibility, we implemented accordions of information for each section in order to allow the user to decide how much information they want to see.

                        The bulk of the coding was completed by my teammate, Adriana Poznanski. She created the HTML code and structure for the dashboards using Bootstrap elements.

                        <br>
                        I implemented the introduction section at the top with hyperlinks to the dashboard, as wel as the automatic slideshow. We both worked on implementing media queries and using Bootstrap for responsiveness.

                        This was my first project working on a website for a real client and the entire process was so gratifying. Being able to produce a website that met both the client and user needs was something that I will continually striver for in all of my designs to come.

                        <br>
                        I loved the topic of this project as well, because I believe in the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and I am grateful to attend a university where this is placed at a high priority among administration.
